# Tenzies 

## Project Description

A simple game won by picking up all dice with the same face. <br/>

Tech stack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React <br/>

Making this gave me an introduction to React Hooks and local storage. <br/>

Future feature ideas: <br/>

1. Add 'levels' where player can choose how many dice to play with. Show different scores per level. 
2. Show a list of scores once play ends to depict where player's latest score ranks on list.

## How to Play

1. 'Roll' to roll dice
2. Click on dice to 'hold' them
3. Continue rolling and holding until all dice are held with the same value
4. Can press 'Restart' button at anytime to restart game
5. Can log score to local storage using the 'Log Score' button. Only the lowest score is shown
